PROJECT: WEB-NEWS WITH REACT.

We will create a web news with React where we can send new news through a form and save them in LocalStorage, and we will show the most read news in the last seven days through the API (https://developer.nytimes.com/apis) .




## Installation

Install my project with npm.
We start the project with React installing vite

```bash
  npm create vite@latest
```

We installed the VSC extension for React. It will help us a lot.

```bash
  https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dsznajder.es7-react-js-snippets
```

We will install the dependencies that we need for this project.

```bash
  npm install sass
  npm install react-router-dom@6
  npm i axios  
```

To avoid having to start the project all the time.

```bash
  npm run dev
```
If all goes well, the following will appear:

```bash
> web-news@0.0.0 dev
> vite

VITE v4.3.9  ready in 1102 ms

  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
  ➜  Network: use --host to expose
  ➜  press h to show help
```
